                 openly-available diffusion MRI (dMRI) data from the Healthy
                 Brain Network (HBN) study. First, we curated the HBN dMRI data
                 (N = 2747) into the Brain Imaging Data Structure and
                 preprocessed it according to best-practices, including
                 denoising and correcting for motion effects,
                 susceptibility-related distortions, and eddy currents.
                 Preprocessed, analysis-ready data was made openly available.
                 Data quality plays a key role in the analysis of dMRI. To
                 optimize QC and scale it to this large dataset, we trained a
                 neural network through the combination of a small data subset
                 scored by experts and a larger set scored by community
                 scientists. The network performs QC highly concordant with
                 that of experts on a held out set (ROC-AUC = 0.947). A further
                 analysis of the neural network demonstrates that it relies on
                 image features with relevance to QC. Altogether, this work
                 both delivers resources to advance transdiagnostic research in
                 brain connectivity and pediatric mental health, and

  abstract = {Importance: Low socioeconomic status (L-SES) and the experience
              of traumatic stressful events (TSEs) are environmental factors
              implicated in behavioral deficits, abnormalities in brain
              development, and accelerated maturation. However, the relative
              contribution of these environmental factors is understudied.
              Objective: To compare the association of L-SES and TSEs with
              psychopathology, puberty, neurocognition, and multimodal
              neuroimaging parameters in brain maturation. Design, Setting, and
              Participants: The Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort is a
              community-based study examining psychopathology, neurocognition,
              and neuroimaging among participants recruited through the
              Children's Hospital of Philadelphia pediatric network.
              Participants are youths aged 8 to 21 years at enrollment with
              stable health and fluency in English. The sample of 9498
              participants was racially (5298 European ancestry [55.8\%], 3124
              African ancestry [32.9\%], and 1076 other [11.4\%]) and
              economically diverse. A randomly selected subsample (n = 1601)
              underwent multimodal neuroimaging. Data were collected from
              November 5, 2009, through December 30, 2011, and analyzed from
              February 1 through November 7, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures:
              The following domains were examined: (1) clinical, including
              psychopathology, assessed with a structured interview based on
              the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for
              School-Age Children, and puberty, assessed with the Tanner scale;
              (2) neurocognition, assessed by the Penn Computerized
              Neurocognitive Battery; and (3) multimodal magnetic resonance
              imaging parameters of brain structure and function. Results: A
              total of 9498 participants were included in the analysis (4906
              [51.7\%] female; mean [SD] age, 14.2 [3.7] years). Clinically,
              L-SES and TSEs were associated with greater severity of
              psychiatric symptoms across the psychopathology domains of
              anxiety/depression, fear, externalizing behavior, and the
              psychosis spectrum. Low SES showed small effect sizes (highest
              for externalizing behavior, 0.306 SD; 95\% CI, 0.269 to 0.342),
              whereas TSEs had large effect sizes, with the highest in females
              for anxiety/depression (1.228 SD; 95\% CI, 1.156 to 1.300) and in
              males for the psychosis spectrum (1.099 SD; 95\% CI, 1.032 to
              1.166). Both were associated with early puberty. Cognitively,
              L-SES had moderate effect sizes on poorer performance, the
              greatest being on complex cognition (-0.500 SD 95\% CI, -0.536 to
              -0.464), whereas TSEs were associated with slightly better memory
              (0.129 SD; 95\% CI, 0.084 to 0.174) and poorer complex reasoning
              (-0.109 SD; 95\% CI, -0.154 to -0.064). Environmental factors had
              common and distinct associations with brain structure and
              function. Structurally, both were associated with lower volume,
              but L-SES had correspondingly lower gray matter density, whereas
              TSEs were associated with higher gray matter density.
              Functionally, both were associated with lower regional cerebral
              blood flow and coherence and with accelerated brain maturation.
              Conclusions and Relevance: Low SES and TSEs are associated with
              common and unique differences in symptoms, neurocognition, and
              structural and functional brain parameters. Both environmental
              factors are associated with earlier completion of puberty by
              physical features and brain parameters. These findings appear to
              underscore the need for identifying and preventing adverse
              environmental conditions associated with neurodevelopment.},

  abstract = {A growing body of research has examined the impact of childhood
              adversity on neural structure and function. Advances in our
              understanding of the neurodevelopmental consequences of adverse
              early environments require the identification of dimensions of
              environmental experience that influence neural development
              differently and mechanisms other than the frequently-invoked
              stress pathways. We propose a novel conceptual framework that
              differentiates between deprivation (absence of expected
              environmental inputs and complexity) and threat (presence of
              experiences that represent a threat to one's physical integrity)
              and make predictions grounded in basic neuroscience principles
              about their distinct effects on neural development. We review
              animal research on fear learning and sensory deprivation as well
              as human research on childhood adversity and neural development
              to support these predictions. We argue that these previously
              undifferentiated dimensions of experience exert strong and
              distinct influences on neural development that cannot be fully
              explained by prevailing models focusing only on stress pathways.
              Our aim is not to exhaustively review existing evidence on
              childhood adversity and neural development, but to provide a
              novel framework to guide future research.},

  abstract  = {Tractography based on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data is a method for identifying the major white matter fascicles (tracts) in the living human brain. The health of these tracts is an important factor underlying many cognitive and neurological disorders. In vivo, tissue properties may vary systematically along each tract for several reasons: different populations of axons enter and exit the tract, and disease can strike at local positions within the tract. Hence quantifying and understanding diffusion measures along each fiber tract (Tract Profile) may reveal new insights into white matter development, function, and disease that are not obvious from mean measures of that tract. We demonstrate several novel findings related to Tract Profiles in the brains of typically developing children and children at risk for white matter injury secondary to preterm birth. First, fractional anisotropy (FA) values vary substantially within a tract but the Tract FA Profile is consistent across subjects. Thus, Tract Profiles contain far more information than mean diffusion measures. Second, developmental changes in FA occur at specific positions within the Tract Profile, rather than along the entire tract. Third, Tract Profiles can be used to compare white matter properties of individual patients to standardized Tract Profiles of a healthy population to elucidate unique features of that patient's clinical condition. Fourth, Tract Profiles can be used to evaluate the association between white matter properties and behavioral outcomes. Specifically, in the preterm group reading ability is positively correlated with FA measured at specific locations on the left arcuate and left superior longitudinal fasciculus and the magnitude of the correlation varies significantly along the Tract Profiles. We introduce open source software for automated fiber-tract quantification (AFQ) that measures Tract Profiles of MRI parameters for 18 white matter tracts. With further validation, AFQ Tract Profiles have potential for informing clinical management and decision-making.},
